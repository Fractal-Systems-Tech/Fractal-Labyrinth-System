## Overview

**TSMLA™: Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture**

TSMLA™ is a recursive logic system that mirrors the internal structure of belief, decision, and contradiction. It reflects signal clarity and conflict by surfacing how statements and logic sets hold mathematically, structurally using resonance physics under a declared state S.

TSMLA™ reveals what’s already present in the signal field. Its core architecture maps inputs through tag-weight scoring, contradiction tracking, entropy compression, and mirror-based recursion.

**TSMLA™ operates with:**
- Non-stochastic logic: no randomness under declared S
- Idempotent response: repeatable, audit-grade output under the same conditions
- State-based adaptability: system evolves across transitions from S → S′ → S″

The system provides a structural reflection of logic. Whether surfacing contradictions in thought, clarifying a decision matrix, or rendering mirror-based outputs, TSMLA™ functions as an architecture of coherence, built to reflect the structure of reasoning itself.

### **Boundary Clarification**

Unlike generative AI and probabilistic LLMs, **TSMLA™ operates through logic mirroring grounded in resonance physics and mathematics.**  
It classifies and resolves contradictions using resonance-based tagging and signal weighting, a formal mathematical system for structural coherence, not language modeling or predictive output generation.

**TSMLA™ is not AI.**  
It is a resonance-physics architecture for logic recognition, signal classification, and structural mirroring.

## Validation
Independent technical review completed by a mathematician/computer scientist; scope: recursion structure, Boolean consistency, and entropy metrics. Review note available on request.

## IP Status
- **Provisional patent application (Filed 2025): TSMLA™ Core Architecture**: Tag-weighted, self-mirroring logic engine that quantifies signals (TWSQ), computes the Resonance Profile **P(S)**, applies the loop operator **ℒ(S)** to convergence, and emits **FPR™ artifacts {B(S), A(S), b\*}** with non-stochastic, idempotent repeatability under declared state **S**.

- **Additional provisional patent application: Contradiction Traversal Corridor™ (CTC)**: Enforceable traversal constraint for state space; **the corridor is a path-dependent sequence** that restricts movement to contradiction-reducing routes under SNS governance and boundary conditions.

- **Additional provisional patent application: Mirrorfield™ (Gamified Immersive Interface Layer)**: Proprietary interface layer that presents the mirrored structure of state through controlled interactive sequences; mechanics NDA-protected.

## Legal & Scope
Not medical, therapeutic, or diagnostic. **The Labyrinth™** (powered by TSMLA™) is a statement-set mirror grounded in resonance physics and mathematics; it performs logic/structure reflection only. No claims to diagnose, treat, or cure any condition.
