# Fractal Labyrinth System™

**Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture™ (TSMLA™)**

*A product of Fractal Labyrinth Systems LLC*

*Public Architecture Overview*

---

## Overview

This repository contains the public-facing documentation for the Fractal Labyrinth System™: a resonance-based logic framework built on deterministic structure, contradiction detection, and recursive decision clarity modeling.

At its core is the **Tag-Weighted Self-Mirroring Logic Architecture™ (TSMLA™)**: a backend system designed to:

- Detect and classify structural contradictions in statement sets
- Map recursive logic patterns in decision-making
- Generate entropy scores quantifying decision space disorder
- Mirror internal logic with deterministic, audit-grade repeatability
- Support modular expansion across domains without backend retraining

---

## System Architecture

TSMLA™ operates on user-provided statement sets S with tag-weights W, producing resonance profiles P(S) comprising:

- **ContradictionMap(S)**: Boolean-detected logical conflicts
- **Loop structure ℒ(S) and depth d**: Recursive pattern detection
- **Decision entropy H(S)**: Normalized disorder measurement
- **BDL type classification**: Multi-type contradiction taxonomy

**Core principle:** Identical inputs produce identical outputs (idempotence). No stochastic elements; all computations are repeatable and auditable.

## Why TSMLA™ Matters

The Fractal Labyrinth System™ is not an AI model, diagnostic tool, or psychological framework. It is a **coherence mirror**: a mathematical engine that reflects logical structure in user-provided statements without prescription, prediction, or external interpretation.

### Core Differentiators

- **No training data dependency:** Operates on statement structure, not learned correlations
- **Idempotent outputs:** Identical inputs always produce identical profiles
- **Non-prescriptive:** Reflects contradictions; does not impose resolutions
- **Module-unbounded:** New domains added via questionnaire design, not model retraining
- **Audit-grade repeatability:** SHA-256 hashed input-output manifests for institutional compliance

### Applications

**Consumer:** Decision clarity modules, relationship pattern mapping, belief system coherence analysis

**Enterprise:** Contradiction auditing for strategy documents, hiring logic verification, jury selection bias detection

**Institutional:** API licensing for education systems, legal tech, financial services, government policy analysis

**Research:** AI safety verification, collective intelligence studies, consciousness development measurement

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Beta Platform (Current)

78 planned modules; user validation studies; idempotence testing; audit tooling

**Target:** Q2 2026

### Phase 2: AI Integration + API Access

Natural language input layer; hardened read-only API; enterprise partnerships; security compliance

**Target:** Q4 2026–Q2 2027

### Phase 3: Fractal Probability Rendering™ (FPR™)

Branch enumeration B(S) with probability scores; non-prescriptive future path projection

**Target:** Q3 2027–Q1 2028

### Phase 4: Timeline Evolution™

Alignment index A(S) and highest-alignment branch selection; resonance compression; entropy-alignment coupling

**Target:** Q1 2029–Q3 2029

### Phase 5+: The Mirrorfield™

Immersive simulation layer; real-time consciousness mirroring; autonomous loop detection; collective consciousness integration

**Target:** Post-Phase 3 validation (est. 2028+)
