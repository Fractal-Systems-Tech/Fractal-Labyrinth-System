## Overview
TSMLA™ is a tag-weighted, self-mirroring logic architecture. It exposes contradictions and entropy in statement sets and provides non-stochastic, idempotent repeatability for a declared state **S**. This paper summarizes core concepts, architecture phases, and validation posture. It is not a generative model.

## Validation
Independent technical review completed by a mathematician/computer scientist; scope: recursion structure, Boolean consistency, and entropy metrics. Review note available on request.

## IP Status
- **Provisional patent application (Filed 2025): TSMLA™ Core Architecture**: Tag-weighted, self-mirroring logic engine that quantifies signals (TWSQ), computes the Resonance Profile **P(S)**, applies the loop operator **ℒ(S)** to convergence, and emits **FPR™ artifacts {B(S), A(S), b\*}** with non-stochastic, idempotent repeatability under declared state **S**.

- **Additional provisional patent application: Contradiction Traversal Corridor™ (CTC)**: Enforceable traversal constraint for state space; **the corridor is a path-dependent sequence** that restricts movement to contradiction-reducing routes under SNS governance and boundary conditions.

- **Additional provisional patent application: Mirrorfield™ (Gamified Immersive Interface Layer)**: Proprietary interface layer that presents the mirrored structure of state through controlled interactive sequences; mechanics NDA-protected.

## Legal & Scope
Not medical, therapeutic, or diagnostic. **The Labyrinth™** (powered by TSMLA™) is a statement-set mirror grounded in resonance physics and mathematics; it performs logic/structure reflection only. No claims to diagnose, treat, or cure any condition.
